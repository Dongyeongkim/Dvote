# Dvote
Dvote is the blockchain e-voting system based on the Proof of Authority


This Blockchain system runs in 'limited time' when people vote, or certificate something.(This system is for voting but it can be used in different place)

The basic structure is defined with 3 components, Genesis BLock with "Public Keys", AES-128 to encrypt the message; control the range to share, and SHA-256
